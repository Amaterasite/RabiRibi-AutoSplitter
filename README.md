# LiveSplit.RabiRibi
Rabi-Ribi Auto Splitter ASL Script for use with LiveSplit

General Notes:  
===  
-Currently only works on version 1.99t of Rabi-Ribi (latest version) but version 1.65 is planned.  
-The default settings are 10TM ready for BunStrike routes (any difficulty should work).  
-IGT is tracked automatically via T.Runtime. You can check this by right clicking > edit splits and checking the Game Time tab or by using the 'Alternative Timing Method' component of LiveSplit found here: http://livesplit.org/components/  
 
Regarding Boss Skips
===
-Performing a boss skip with their split option checked will split when the boss despawns. Basically as soon as you screen transition for the following bosses:  
    -Nixie  
    -Syaro  
    -Aruraune  
    -Kotri 3  
 
-If you are performing Syaro Skip, you can use the Syaro Skip option INSTEAD of the Syaro option. The Syaro Skip option will split when you leave System Interior. If you have both options checked, you will split twice when performing Syaro Skip.  
-The Noah Skip option will split as you transition to the room where Noah 3 is. Use this option for both Noah Skip and BunStrike Zip routes.
